# Jelly Roll

Jelly Roll is a fork of the Satchmo shopping cart. (forked from version 0.8)

It's main aims are:
* To be easier to install and use than Satchmo
* To be just a Django app (no standalone version)
* To have less exotic dependencies than Satchmo
* To have a stable release that works with the stable release of Django, and requires no unusual or hard to acquire dependencies
* No Magic! (remove as much of Satcmo's magic as possible)

It's not there yet... Still have a lot of work to do.
