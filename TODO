* Rename the project directory from satchmo to jellyroll
* Only require jellyroll to be install in applications (not all of the sub-parts too)
* Sort out documentation directory.
* Move all fixtures to xml (or JSON) as YAML isn't universally supported. (remove python-yaml to test)
* Remove the registration stuff
* Remove the Google Stuff (probably)
* Remove thumbnails
* Translation seems wrong.  If it is, fix it.
* Export forms are returning HTTP responses. Should not do that...
* TODO: Don't depend on SATCHMO_DIRNAME for things like templates!
* Remove base_satchmo.html
* Create demo store
* Simplify all templates
* Remove PDF generation of Invocies, etc.  HTML is fine.
* Remove blackbird logging
* Sort Order should default to 0 when editing products, product categories and brand categories in Admin
* Contact model shouldn't have contact types hardcoded
* Don't put bit's of queries in the URL (see satchmo/templates/admin/order_sidebar.html)
