Shipping Module Activation
--------------------------

Satchmo provides you the flexibility to enable and disable as many shipping modules
as you would like.  Since everyone has different needs for shipping, there's a simple
but powerful way to define your own shipping modules.

In order to enable modules, make sure your local_settings.py file has a line similar
to this::

    #Shipping Modules to enable
    SHIPPING_MODULES = ['satchmo.shipping.modules.per', 'satchmo.shipping.modules.flat']

This line tells Satchmo to use these two modules as options to present to users when they
check out.

Shipping Modules Customization
------------------------------

As they stand now, these modules are fairly simple. If you would like to create your own:

 1. Copy dummy.py to a new name
 2. Edit your new file to ensure it calculates the values you'd like.
 3. Enable it in the SHIPPING_MODULES settings described above.
