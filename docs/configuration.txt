Basic Configuration
===================

Store Settings
--------------

.. index::
   single: settings; SHOP_BASE
   single: settings; LOCAL_DEV

If you followed the installation steps, you should have a basic store to start playing with.  There are a
number of places you might want to configure.

1. In the settings.py (or local_settings.py) file, there are a number of general Django settings.  However, there are a
   few that are specific to Satchmo.

    - ``SHOP_BASE`` is used as the prefix for your store.  In the default setting, your store is
      located at www.yourname.com/shop.  If you would like to change this setting, this is the
      place to do it.  If you would like your store to be at the root of the url, set
      ``SHOP_BASE = ""``
    - ``LOCAL_DEV`` is used to make sure static files are served properly when developing.  This must
      be set to FALSE when you deploy your site.
    - Make sure that your ``DATABASE_ENGINE`` variable is also set correctly.
    - You should ensure that all of your paths are setup correctly.  Key ones to look at are:

        + ``MEDIA_ROOT`` (this is where images will be stored)
        + ``MEDIA_URL``
        + ``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX``
        + ``TEMPLATE_DIRS``

Site Settings
-------------

The majority of the store configuration is done through the admin interface. Satchmo has a flexible Site Settings capability that can be accessed through the admin interface or through the url: /settings

All of the configuration settings have detailed help notes. They also default to sensible configurations so your initial store should work fine without changing any values.

Base Settings
+++++++++++++

These items are used for general store configuration and include:

    - Account verification options
    - Default currency symbol
    - Enable/disable product ratings
    - Controlling display of featured products
    - Controlling quality of thumbnail creating

.. index::
   single: Google; analytics
   single: Google; adwords

Google Settings
+++++++++++++++

This section allows you to enable or disable google analytics and conversion tracking for adwords.

Language Settings
+++++++++++++++++

Allows the user to manually choose their language they would like to see.

Payment Settings
++++++++++++++++

Satchmo can handle multiple ways of accepting payment.  By default, you have a dummy processor that does nothing but accept payments.  Obviously, you'll want to enable one of the other modules before going live.

Each payment module will have it's own configuration items. These items apply universally to all payment modules.

    - Accept real payments
    - Allow URL access for cron rebilling of subscriptions
    - Force ship to and bill to countries to match during checkout
    - Cron passkey to allow subscription rebilling
    - Enable/disable ssl for the checkout process
    - Enable specific payment modules.

.. Note::
    If you add a new payment module, you will need to save the changes in order for the new payment module configuration items to appear.

.. Note::
    After saving changes to your payment processor, you will need to restart your server for the changes to take effect.

.. index::
   single: Product types; enabling
