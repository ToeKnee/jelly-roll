Satchmo Introduction
=====================

History
-------
Like most Open Source projects, Satchmo was started to "scratch an itch."  This
particular itch was to create a framework for developing shopping cart software
using the Django framework.  After a little bit of discussion on the Django list, 
we created our own project in April 2006.

Project Mission
---------------
Satchmo's mission is to use Django to create an open source framework for creating 
unique and robust online stores. To provide maximum flexibility, Satchmo is licensed 
under the BSD license.

Current Development Status
--------------------------
With the release of version 0.5, Satchmo will enter beta status.  All the basic 
functionalities required to run the store are present.  Many advanced functions are also available.
While we have tried to squash all of the bugs, there still may be a few out there.  We are
also striving to maintain a stable api going forward.  All future releases will contain
instructions on how to migrate the changes.
