Helpful Hints
=============
Here are two shell aliases I use to make it a little easier to develop::

    alias delpyc='find ./ -type f -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;'
    alias startserver='python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.9:8000'

The delpyc is helpful if you want to clear out all your .pyc files and make 
sure there isn't any weirdness with old files.

The startserver just makes it easier to start up the development server
with a given IP.

The load_data.py script is used to dump your current database and install some sample data.
Please make sure you know what you're doing before you dump your database - the data will be lost!

Thanks
