The Satchmo project requires a recent (post-magic-removal) version of Django.
Until a baseline is made, we encourage you to use the latest svn version.

To get the latest version of Django:
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/

You must now configure Django & get it working on your system.  Follow the
instructions here -
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/

After Django is working, you can check out the latest version of Satchmo, using
this command -
svn co http://svn.satchmo.python-hosting.com/trunk/

Since we're still putting this project together, you willl more than likely
be running this in the development server.  In order to ease the check-in and
check-out process, we've modified the settings.py file so that some of the key
information is read from environment variables.  In order for everything to
work right on your machine, you should set the following variables in your
shell (e.g. .bashrc)

export PYTHONPATH="/home/user/django-mr/trunk:/home/user/working-dir/satchmo/trunk"
export DJANGO_PROJECT='satchmo'
export DJANGO_DB_NAME='YOURDBNAME'
export DJANGO_DB_PASS='YOURPASSWORD'
export DJANGO_DB_USER='YOURUSER'
export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='YOURSECRETKEY'
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='satchmo.settings'

After making these changes, make sure you source your environment again so they
are visible.

Next, install your databases:
cd /path/to/satchmo
python manage.py syncdb

Once the database is installed, try the development server
python manage.py runserver

Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see the admin interface

Helpful Hints
=============
Here are two shell aliases I use to make it a little easier to develop
alias delpyc='find ./ -type f -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;'
alias startserver='python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.9:8000'

The delpyc is helpful if you want to clear out all your .pyc files and make 
sure there isn't any weirdness with old files.

The startserver just makes it easier to start up the development server
with a given IP.

Thanks
