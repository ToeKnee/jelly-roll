Products
========

The core of any online store is the product or item you are selling.  Some people may have very simple needs for categorizing and describing their products, while others may have much more complex needs.  Satchmo's product framework tries to strike a balance, enabling easy product configuration but supporting complex products if your needs demand.

Categories
----------

Out of the box, Satchmo supports the traditional hierarchical method for categorizing products.  In other words, you can create category trees like this:

 * Movies

   - Action
   - Western
   - Comedy
   - Black and White

     + Foreign
     + English
     + Silent

 * Books

   - Fiction
   - Non-fiction
    
Some things to keep in mind with Satchmo's implementation:

 * You are not limited to the number of categories or the depth of categories.
 * You are allowed to add products to 1 or more products
 
When entering a category in the admin interface, you will have several fields to fill in.  Below is a description of each field and how it is used:

Name
    The name of this specific category.  It is the text seen by the user to describe this category.  In the example above, Movies, Action, etc. are all names.
    
Slug
    This is a prepopulated field that is used in the url to identify the category.  One aspect that Django encourages is well designed urls.  The slug field is commonly used so that a url "makes sense" when you look at it.  The nice side effect of this is that in some cases, search engines will give higher ranking for sites with cleaner urls.
    
Parent
    If a category is at the top of the tree, then there is no parent.  In our example above, Movies and Books have no parents.  While Action, Comedy, Black and White would all have Movies as a parent.
    
Meta
    When an HTML page is constructed, certain meta information can be added to the page which makes it easier for search engines to classify your pages and your products.  This field is used to enter information about your category that may not be readily seen by just looking at a description.
    
Description
    This is a free form field that describes this category.  You can use this to help guide users in your site.  It's also helpful for search engines.
    
Item
----

An Item is the main focus of your store.  It is the "thing" that a person going to your store would see.  There are many fields you can use to configure your Items.

Category
    See the description above.  This is where you choose one or more categories where a person could find this product.
    
Verbose_name
    This is the full name of an item.  Think of it as the title of the item.
    
Short_name
    This is similar to the slug field in category.  It is a brief description of the item that will show up in the url and uniquely identify this product.
    
Description
    Free form text fields that tell a potential customer about this item and why they may want to purchase it.

Meta
    This meta field is similar to the one described above in the category.  It's basically some additional descriptive language you might want to include in your HTML that does not already show up in the description.
    
Date_added
    The date you added this product to your store.  It could be useful for showing a list of new products.
    
Active
    A flag to identify which items are still valid in the store.  If you decide you don't want to show an item for purchase, I recommend making it Active=False instead of trying to delete it.
    
Featured
    Another flag which can be used to identify special items that you may want to highlight in your site.
    
Option group
    This is a collection of descriptions that identify this item.  See more details below.
    
Base_price
    An item has multiple ways to determine a price.  In the absence of any of the more advanced methods, this is the price that will be shown to the customer.  When using some of the other methods to calculate price, this value sets the baseline which can be increased or decreased depending on your rules.
    
Weight, Length and Height
    These dimensions are for your use in displaying the item's info. It can also be used for shipping calculations.

Create_subs
    This is a special option that allows you to create sub_items.  You can learn more about sub_items below.
    
Related_items
    Certain products may naturally be grouped together.  If you were to purchase a movie, you might want to include links to the book based on the movie or maybe a movie poster.  This would be the place to record those linkages.
    
Also_purchased
    Another field to show relationships between products.  This can be useful if you want to try to increase sales by showing what others have purchased when they bought this product.
    
Taxable
    A flag to tell whether or not tax should be calculated for this product.  More information on taxes can be found ...
    
Tax_class
    Allows you to set the rate at which tax is calculated.
