Satchmo Introduction
=====================

History
-------
Like most Open Source projects, Satchmo was started to "scratch an itch."  This
particular itch was to create a framework for developing shopping cart software
using the Django framework.  After a little bit of discussion on the Django list, 
we created our own project in April 2006.

Project Mission
---------------
Satchmo's mission is to use Django to create an open source framework for creating 
unique and robust online stores. To provide maximum flexibility, Satchmo is licensed 
under the BSD license.

Current Development Status
--------------------------
Satchmo is currently in alpha status.  Many functions work but there is still a lot
of change in the underlying api.
