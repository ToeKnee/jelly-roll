Basic Configuration
===================

Store Settings
--------------

If you followed the installation steps, you should have a basic store to start playing with.  There are a
number of places you might want to configure.

1. In the settings.py (or local_settings.py) file, there are a number of general Django settings.  However, there are a
   few that are specific to Satchmo.

    - SHOP_BASE is used as the prefix for your store.  In the default setting, your store is 
      located at www.yourname.com/shop.  If you would like to change this setting, this is the 
      place to do it.
    - LOCAL_DEV is used to make sure static files are served properly when developing.  This must
      be set to FALSE when you deploy your site.
    - CURRENCY is the currency symbol to use within the store.
    - Make sure that your DATABASE_ENGINE variable is also set correctly.
    - You should ensure that all of your paths are setup correctly.  Key ones to look at are:
        
        + MEDIA_ROOT (this is where images will be stored)
        + MEDIA_URL
        + ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX
        + TEMPLATE_DIRS
        
2. The local_settings.py file also includes information for configuring `Authorize.net`_.  Make changes
   here if you are planning to use this service.

3. The load_data.py script is helpful during testing. Make sure the following values are set in your
   local_settings.py file:

    - SITE_DOMAIN = "example.com"
    - SITE_NAME = "My Site"

Module Configurations
---------------------

There are a number of additional places where you can customize Satchmo for your needs.

One setting that will need to be modified is the payment processor you need to use for processing
credit cards.  A module for `Authorize.net`_ is included but not installed by default.  A dummy module
is installed that does nothing but return a true value.  To change to authorize.net, change the import
statement in satchmo/shop/views/checkout-step3 from::
    
    #from satchmo.payment.modules.authorizenet import PaymentProcessor
    # Change this to your appropriate payment processor
    from satchmo.payment.modules.dummy import PaymentProcessor
    
to::

    from satchmo.payment.modules.authorizenet import PaymentProcessor
    # Change this to your appropriate payment processor
    #from satchmo.payment.modules.dummy import PaymentProcessor
    
Satchmo allows very flexible shipping calculations.  You will want to tailor the default ones stored
in /satchmo/shipping/modules.py.  The API is fairly simple but will be covered in more detail later
in this document.

Satchmo has support for selling taxable products.  Since tax calculations include many different 
calculations, you can modify the tax calculations using the objects in /satchmo/tax/modules.py.  The
API will be covered in more detail later in this document.

SSL Security can be set on any url in your store.  In order for SSL to work,
make sure that it is enabled in the middleware section of your settings.py::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
	"django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
	"django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware",
        "satchmo.shop.SSLMiddleware.SSLRedirect"
			    )

Then, enable it for the specific urls you would like to be protected by adding
{'SSL': True} to each url.  Here's and example in /shop/urls.py::

         (r'^checkout/$','checkout-step1.contact_info', {'SSL':True}),
         (r'^checkout/pay/$','checkout-step2.pay_ship_info', {'SSL':True}),  
         (r'^checkout/confirm/$','checkout-step3.confirm_info', {'SSL':True}), 

.. _Authorize.net: http://www.authorize.net/
