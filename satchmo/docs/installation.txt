Installation
============

This guide assumes that Django is properly installed and that you have installed the
dependencies mentioned in the requirements section.

1. Get the latest Satchmo source::

        svn co svn://satchmoproject.com/satchmo/trunk/
        
The next two steps depend on whether or not Satchmo is a standalone project or just an app that
is part of another Django project.

If Satchmo is a standalone app (follow steps 2 and 3):

2.  Modify Satchmo's default settings-customize.py file::
    cp settings-customize.py settings.py
    
3.  Modify settings.py to reflect your setup.

If Satchmo is part of another Django app (follow step 4):

4. Modify you project settings.py file so that it has the following line at the end::

        from local_settings import *
    
5.  Create your customized local_settings.py file::
    
        cp local_settings-customize.py local_settings.py

6.  Edit this local_settings.py file for your setup. The following values need to be changed::

        DATABASE_NAME = 'Your DB Name Here'
        DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'Your DB Password Here'
        DATABASE_USER = 'Your DB User Here'
        SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key here'
        
        Any other values that are applicable to your setup

.. warning::
    The next step can erase data in the satchmo database. Be sure to have a backup of any critical data

7.  Load the sample data::

        python load_data.py
    
8.  When prompted, enter Yes to all the questions.  This script will also install the i18n data.

9.  Start up the sample webserver to see your store::

        python manage.py startserver
        
10.  In order to see your sample store, point your browser to::
    
        http://localhost/store to see your store

11.  If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::

        http://localhost/admin

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup.  If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work.  If not, use the appropriate url.
